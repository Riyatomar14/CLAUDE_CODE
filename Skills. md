# Claude Skills – Complete Notes

> Version context: **Claude Code v2.0.61**, **Sonnet 4.5**, Claude Pro

---

## 1. What is a Skill?

A **Skill** is a structured folder that contains instructions, documentation, and optionally executable code that Claude can **read or run** when required.

**Key characteristics:**

* Lives inside **Claude’s virtual machine (VM)**
* Used to provide **tools + instructions** to Claude
* Designed for **progressive disclosure** (only load what is needed)
* Enables modular, reusable, and scoped capabilities

---

## 2. Basic Skill Folder Structure

```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md
```

* A skill can be as small as a **single file**
* `SKILL.md` is **mandatory**
* `SKILL.md` acts as the **main entry point** for the skill

---

## 3. SKILL.md (Main Skill File)

`SKILL.md` has **two core components**:

### 1️⃣ Metadata

Loaded **at startup**

* Skill name
* Skill description

### 2️⃣ Body

Loaded **only when the skill is invoked**

* Actual instructions for Claude
* Written in **Markdown**

### Relationship

```
System Prompt + Skill Metadata
            ↓
      SKILL.md Body
   (used only when called)
```

---

## 4. Skills with Additional Instruction Files

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
└── how-to-x.md
```

* Extra `.md` files contain **supplementary instructions**
* Claude reads them **only if explicitly referenced**

**Flow:**

```
Claude calls skill
→ Skill body references how-to-x.md
→ Claude reads file as context
```

---

## 5. Skills with Organized Folders (How‑tos)

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
└── how-tos/
    ├── x.md
    ├── y.md
    └── z.md
```

* Subfolders are used for **logical organization**
* Helps Claude access **only relevant information**

**Flow:**

```
Skill body
→ references how-tos
→ Claude selectively reads x.md / y.md / z.md
```

---

## 6. Skills with Executable Code

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── how-to-x.md
└── scripts/
    └── foo.py
```

### Code Support

Claude can execute scripts using:

* **Bash**
* **Python**
* **Node.js**

**Example:**

```
python scripts/foo.py
```

**Execution Flow:**

```
Skill body references scripts/foo.py
→ Claude executes it inside the VM
```

---

## 7. How Claude Uses a Skill (Execution Flow)

1. Claude detects the **need for a skill**
2. Skill metadata is already in context
3. Claude loads the **SKILL.md body**
4. Additional files/folders are read **only if referenced**
5. Scripts are executed **if required**

---

## 8. Progressive Disclosure (Very Important)

### Definition

> Providing Claude with **just enough context** for the next step.

### Levels of Disclosure

| Level | Content           | When It Enters Context | Token Cost |
| ----: | ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
|     1 | SKILL.md metadata | On startup             | ~100       |
|     2 | SKILL.md body     | When skill is invoked  | < 5k       |
|     3 | Files & folders   | As needed              | No limit   |

### Result

* Better context management
* Lower token usage
* Higher reasoning quality

---

## 9. Skills vs MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### Skills

* Provide **tools + instructions** to Claude
* **Claude‑only** feature
* Uses **progressive disclosure**

**Primary use:**

> Teaching Claude *how to do things* using available tools 🧠

---

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

* Universal, **open standard**
* Works across **multiple LLMs**
* All tools + metadata loaded **at startup**

**Primary use:**

> Giving Claude access to **complex tools and integrations** 🧪

---

## 10. Skills, MCP, & Subagents

### Conceptual Roles

* **Subagents**

  * Specialized agents for specific workflows
  * Each has its **own context window**

* **Skills**

  * Specialized instructions and tools
  * Optimized via progressive disclosure

* **MCP Servers**

  * Specialized, external toolsets
  * Integration‑focused

---

## 11. How Everything Fits Together

### High‑Level Architecture

```
Main Claude Code Agent
        │
        ▼
   Calls Subagent
        │
        ▼
     Subagent
   ┌──────────────┐
   │  Skill 3     │
   │  MCP Server  │
   └──────────────┘
        │
        ▼
   Executes tools
        │
        ▲
        └── Returns result
```

### Key Insight

* **Main agent** orchestrates
* **Subagents** specialize
* **Skills** guide behavior
* **MCP** provides powerful external capabilities

---

## Summary

Skills are Claude’s **instructional intelligence layer**:

* Lightweight
* Modular
* Efficient
* Context‑aware

They complement **Subagents** and **MCP**, forming a scalable architecture for advanced Claude Code workflows.
