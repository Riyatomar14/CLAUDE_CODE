Claude Code – Structured Notes

1. Basic CLI Commands

claude "query"
claude -c
claude update

claude -p "query"
cat file | claude -p "query"

Explanation

claude "query" → Run a simple prompt

-p → Pipe input (stdin) to Claude

-c → Continue / context-aware execution (session-based)

claude update → Update Claude CLI to latest version



---

2. Slash Commands (Interactive Mode)

/help       → List all commands
/login      → Authenticate account
/logout     → Logout session
/model      → View or change model
/cost       → Show usage cost
/init       → Initialize project (creates CLAUDE.md)
/add-dir    → Add directory to context
/clear      → Clear current context window
/compact    → Compress context to save space


---

3. Context Window (Very Important Concept)

What is Context Window?

Context window is the temporary memory space where all information is collected and processed.

Claude does NOT remember past conversations or previous sessions.

It only sees what is inside the current context window.


Context Window Size

Defines how much information Claude can process at one time.


Why Context Window Matters

✅ Complete context → Better reasoning

❌ Incomplete context → Incomplete understanding

❌ Irrelevant context → Wasted space

Changing context → Changing answers


Key Rule

> Claude answers are 100% dependent on what is inside the context window.




---

4. /context Command

Used to inspect or manage what information is currently loaded.

Helps debug why Claude is giving certain answers.



---

5. CLAUDE.md File

How to Generate

/init

This auto-generates a CLAUDE.md file.

What CLAUDE.md Should Include

1. Project overview
2. Common commands (build, test, deploy)
3. Code style rules
4. Testing guidelines
5. Known pitfalls / warnings
6. Environment setup
7. Tools & versions
8. Project directory structure

Purpose

Acts as persistent instructions for Claude

Re-loaded into context every time



---

6. Claude Skills

What are Claude Skills?

Modular capabilities added to Claude Code

Each skill lives in a SKILL.md file


Structure of a Skill

1. Name of the skill
2. Description of the skill
3. Instructions (how Claude should behave)

Skill Locations

~/.claude/skills/        → Global skills
./.claude/skills/       → Local (project-specific) skills

Why Skills Matter

Reusable behavior

Cleaner prompts

Consistent outputs



---

7. Output Styles

Claude supports different output modes:

1. default       → Normal concise answers
2. explanatory  → Step-by-step explanations
3. learning     → Teaching-oriented, beginner friendly

Use when clarity or teaching is required.


---

8. Hooks (Powerful Feature)

What are Hooks?

Automation layer for Claude Code

Triggered on every action

Improves security & reliability


Why Hooks are Needed

Prompts are probabilistic

Behavior may vary each run

Hooks enforce consistency


Hooks & JSON

Hooks send event data as JSON

Processed using JQ library


Install JQ

# Windows
winget install jqlang.jq


---

9. Sub-Agents

What are Sub-Agents?

Specialized Claude assistants

Focused on specific tasks (testing, refactoring, security, etc.)


Benefits

Parallel thinking

Cleaner architecture

Task specialization



---

10. MCP (Model Context Protocol)

What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol, not a single tool or CLI

It defines how models, tools, skills, and agents communicate

Used to connect Claude with external systems in a structured way


Key Points

Claude Code has native MCP support

You do NOT need to install MCP to use Claude Code

You install MCP only when building custom tools, servers, or agents


Correct Installation (When Needed)

pip install mcp

When MCP Installation is Required

Building custom MCP servers

Creating external tools for Claude

Implementing multi-agent workflows


When MCP Installation is NOT Required

Normal Claude Code usage

Using skills (SKILL.md)

Using hooks


Common Mistake ❌

pip install mcpiclij   # ❌ Incorrect / not official

Exam / Interview Line

> MCP is a protocol layer; Claude Code supports it natively, and developers install MCP libraries only when building custom tools or agents.




---

11. Important Points Often Missed

Claude is stateless by default

Context ≠ Memory

CLAUDE.md + Skills = Long-term behavior

Hooks = Deterministic control

Smaller context = Faster & cheaper

Garbage context = Garbage output



---

12. Mental Model (Exam / Interview Ready)

Prompt → Context Window → Skills → Hooks → Model → Output Style → Response


---

13. Best Practices

Keep context minimal & relevant

Use /compact regularly

Move repeated instructions to CLAUDE.md

Convert long prompts into skills

Use hooks for safety-critical tasks



---

14. One-Line Summary

> Claude Code works best when context is clean, instructions are modular, and behavior is enforced via hooks.
